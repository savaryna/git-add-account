# @savaryna/add-git-account

üîê A small CLI app that allows you to easily add multiple Git accounts on one machine. It switches between accounts automatically based on the workspace you are in.

## CLI usage

Run the command direcly with

```shell
npx @savaryna/git-add-account
```

or if you installed it globally with

```shell
npm i -g @savaryna/git-add-account
```

then you can run it using

```shell
git-add-account
# or the shorter version
gaa
```

For usage and command details run it with the `--help` option.

After going through all the steps, you will be presented with your public SSH key so you can copy, and add it to your Git provider. For example GitHub[^1]:

1. Copy the public SSH key.
1. Go to the [SSH keys settings page](https://github.com/settings/keys).
1. Click on `New SSH key`.
1. Add the key as an `Authentication Key`.
1. Click on `Add SSH key`.
1. Add the same key again as a `Signing Key` if you chose to sign your work[^2].

Done! Any `git` command you run from the workspace you chose **(and its subdirectories)**, will now use this new account automatically.

## How it works

A simple way to use multiple Git accounts on one machine is to use different SSH configs based on the directory you are in. The way [@savaryna/add-git-account](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@savaryna/git-add-account) works is, it asks you for some basic information and then it creates files under `.config/` in the workspace directory you specified.

1. It creates a private/public `ed25519` SSH keypair using `ssh-keygen` ([see code](https://github.com/savaryna/git-add-account/blob/main/src/helpers/config.ts#L28-L29)).
1. It creates a `sshconfig` file based on this [template](https://github.com/savaryna/git-add-account/blob/main/src/templates/sshconfig.mustache).
1. It creates a `gitconfig` file based on this [template](https://github.com/savaryna/git-add-account/blob/main/src/templates/gitconfig.mustache).
1. It appends a conditional include to your global Git config based on this [template](https://github.com/savaryna/git-add-account/blob/main/src/templates/gitconfig.global.mustache). This makes sure that any `git` command you run from the workspace you chose **(and its subdirectories)**, will now use this new account automatically[^3].
1. Finally, it presents you with your public SSH key so you can copy, and add it to your Git provider.
